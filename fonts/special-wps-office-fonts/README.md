The following solution is a command will copy the missing fonts from the downloaded/cloned folder to your system WPS Office fonts folder. This should work for all Linux distros.

1. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/iykrichie/wps-office-19-missing-fonts-on-Linux) somewhere and open the folder.

3. Move or copy the folder `special-wps-office-fonts` to `/usr/share/fonts/`.
